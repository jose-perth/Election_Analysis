# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Project

This project is the third weekly challenge of the Data Science Bootcamp.  It allows us to put into practice and showcase the skills learned in Module 3 of the bootcamp.

### Purpose

The Colorado Board of Elections has requested information to be computed from their input file. This information will be included as part of an election audit.

The information requested includes:

- Total number of votes cast
- County information:
    - The voter turnout for each county
    - The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
    - The county with the highest turnout
- Complete list of candidates who received votes
- Total number of votes each candidate received
- Percentage of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on popular vote

## Results
Analysis of the provided .csv input file was carried out using Python 3.9.2.  The output file is [election_results](/analysis/election_results.txt).

[input file](/resources/election_results.csv)   :arrow_right: [Python Script](PyPoll_Challenge.py)    :arrow_right: [election_results](/analysis/election_results.txt)


Deliverable 1: The Election Results Printed to the Command Line
Deliverable 2: The Election Results Saved to a Text File
Deliverable 3: A written Analysis of the Election Audit (README.md)

The data consists of a number for the ballot ID and a name for the county and candidate, respectively. 

## Election Audit Results

## Election Audit Summary
In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.
